#' This function determines if lobster passes through a trap and determines if it is caught
#' @param loc1 is the location of lobster at the start of each time step
#' @param loc2 is the location of lobster at the end of each time step
#' @param Trap is the location of trap
#' @param howClose sets the distance from the trap within which catch occurs
#' @return Returns a vector that contain lobster path and if it is trapped or not
#' @export
