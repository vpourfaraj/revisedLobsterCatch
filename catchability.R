#' This function calculates the probability of entry to trap (aka catchability). In addition to parameters in Addison & Bell
#' 1997, length of catch can is added and can be included in calculation of catchability.
#' @param q0 is the initial probability of entry into an empty trap(i.e. 0.5).
#' @param qmin is the asymptotic minimum probability of entry (i.e. 0).
#' @param  saturationThreshold is the number of lobsters in a trap at which the probability of
#' another lobster entering the trap drops to qmin
#' @param Ct is the number of caught lobster
#' @param r is the instantaneous rate of change in qo with respect to Ct
#' @param lengthBased is a logical parameter(TRUE/FALSE) which determines if length of catch needs too be considered 
#' @param lobLengthThreshold is a length threshold (i.e. CL in centimeters) beyond which there is no chance of catching another lobster
#' @param lobSize is a size frequency dataset which is set to NA by default 
#' @param lobSex is the sex of the lobster 
#' @return Returns the probability of entry to trap
